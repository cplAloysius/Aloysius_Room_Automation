In this repo, I log my experience attempting to automate various appliances in my room with:
- ESP8266 webserver to send commands remotely
- IR transmitter to communicate with Mitsubishi air conditioner
- 433MHz radio frequency transmitter to communicate with smart light switch
- Arduino nano with 2 channel relay and 433Mhz RF receiver fitted into a KDK standing fan
- Arduino nano with 2 channel relay and 433Mhz RF receiver controlling a linear actuator to operate a sliding door
